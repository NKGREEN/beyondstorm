		<h1>Beyond Storm: Black Women in Comics</h1>
		 <p class="intro">Goddess, master thief, team leader; all of these terms and more have described
      Ororo Munroe, known as <a href="http://www.marvel.com/universe/Storm" target=_blank">Storm</a></li>, throughout her evolution in the Marvel Universe.
      While not the first black woman to appear in a comic, she is 
      certainly the most well-known. She is the one most 9-year-old black, female comic book readers (like myself) saw something of themselves in. However, as wonderful as it may be to see yourself in a goddess, it is also important to see your reflection in role models that lend themselves more to dealing with the everyday challenges you may face. </p>
      
      <p> The comics landscape has definitely changed for the better. Over time, there has been greater inclusion of black women as heroes (and villans), as well as more characters of other underrepresented ethnicities. Please explore these pages to see just a few of the beautiful, complex, and powerful black women emerging from the panels of today's comics.
